Dr. Pearce’s current research aims to: 1) characterize cognitive function, neural food-cue responsivity, and eating behaviors in children at high and low familial risk for obesity prior to the development of excess adiposity; 2) identify neurocognitive processes and eating behaviors that confer either risk or resiliency to pediatric obesity; and 3) characterize child eating behaviors through meal microstructure and computational modeling.\nazp271@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriana Ezray Wham is Research Data Librarian – STEM at the Penn State University Libraries.

    "text": "About the workshop\nEffective data management supports research integrity, reproducibility, and the long-term value of data. This workshop will introduce practical approaches for implementing better data practices across the research lifecycle — from organizing and describing data during active projects to preparing data for sharing and reuse. Topics will include directory structures and file naming conventions, copyright considerations for research data and code, and documentation formats such as data dictionaries, metadata standards, and README files. Through hands-on activities, participants will apply these practices to common research scenarios.\nThis workshop will provide a set of practices that can make data management and data sharing easier taught by local experts who have helped many researchers with related challenges.\nAlaina Pearce, Briana Wham, and Ana Enriquez will lead the workshop.\nMore details about the schedule and faculty can be found by following the links."
