## About the workshop

Effective data management supports research integrity, reproducibility, and the long-term value of data. This workshop will introduce practical approaches for implementing better data practices across the research lifecycle — from organizing and describing data during active projects to preparing data for sharing and reuse. Topics will include directory structures and file naming conventions, copyright considerations for research data and code, and documentation formats such as data dictionaries, metadata standards, and README files. Through hands-on activities, participants will apply these practices to common research scenarios. 

This workshop will provide a set of practices that can make data management and data sharing easier taught by local experts who have helped many researchers with related challenges.

[Alaina Pearce](people.qmd#alaina-pearce), [Briana Wham](people.qmd#briana-wham), and [Ana Enriquez](people.qmd#ana-enriquez) will lead the workshop.
