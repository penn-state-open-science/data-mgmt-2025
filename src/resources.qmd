## Consulting OpenAI

Just for fun, we thought we would ask [OpenAI](https://openai.com) for some insights about data management practices.

The following code sketch is not run and will not work as-is, but is used as a sketch for how to do this sort of thing.

```{r}
#| label: open-ai-image
#| eval: FALSE

ai_img <- openai::create_image(prompt = "good enough data management practices", size="512x512", response_format = "url")
```

![OpenAI response to "good enough data management practices"](include/img/open-ai-good-enough-data-mgmt.png)

Similarly, the response below was generated from the prompt "suggestions about good enough data management practices".

```{r}
#| label: open-ai-text
#| eval: FALSE

create_chat_completion(model = "gpt-3.5-turbo",
                       messages = list(
                         list("role" = "user",
                              "content" = "suggestions about good enough data management practices")
                       ))
```
