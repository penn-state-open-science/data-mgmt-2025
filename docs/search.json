This workshop will introduce practical approaches for implementing better data practices across the research lifecycle — from organizing and describing data during active projects to preparing data for sharing and reuse. Topics will include directory structures and file naming conventions, copyright considerations for research data and code, and documentation formats such as data dictionaries, metadata standards, and README files. Through hands-on activities, participants will apply these practices to common research scenarios.\nThis workshop will provide a set of practices that can make data management and data sharing easier taught by local experts who have helped many researchers with related challenges.\nAlaina Pearce, Briana Wham, and Ana Enriquez will lead the workshop.\nMore details about the schedule and faculty can be found by following the links."
